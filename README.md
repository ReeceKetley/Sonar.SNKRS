# Sonar.SNKRS
(Old Backup 2013)An advanced fast &amp; commercially successful Nike store add to cart bot written using my reverse engineering efforts of the SNKRS app and api.  Secured using my own PHP based API based on Rijndael 256 &amp; a time based hash &amp; salt based encryption to ensure the data was never the same twice.
